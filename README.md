# Shaded-Teapot-
We want to be able to load an object from a file and then add some lighting to the object.
A flat-shaded teapot with the light coming from below and to the right of the camera. Should be upright on the screen and rotate to show off the spout and handle.
Used an orthographic projection that includes the whole teapot rotating in the scene to show off the shading.
